# Generalisation-of-MADD-and-XceptionNet-Honours-Project

This project investigates the generalisation ability of deepfkae dtection models across diverse image datasets. Specifically, it compares the Multi-Attentional Deepfake Detector (MADD0 and XceptionNet models trained on the FaceForensics++ (FF++) dataset and fine-tuned on DF40 dataset. 

The main goal is to assess how well deepfake detection models trained on one dataset (FF++) can generalise to unseen datasets (DF40). This helps understand model robustness against distribution shifts in real-world scenarios.

Key Components

Datasets:

Training: FaceForensics++ (FF++)

Evaluation: DeepfakeBench_DF40

Models:

MADD (Multi-attentional Deepfake Detector)

XceptionNet

Tasks:

Model training, validation, and testing

Cross-dataset evaluation and performance comparison

Metric-based analysis of generalisation ability

Outcomes

This project provides insights into how model architecture and training data influence deepfake detection performance across domains, contributing to research on robust and generalisable deepfake detection systems.

## The files provided are the files to train the MADD and XceptionNet models on the FaceForensics++ and DF40 datasets. Those datasets and models have to be downloaded at the resepctive author's repositories.
